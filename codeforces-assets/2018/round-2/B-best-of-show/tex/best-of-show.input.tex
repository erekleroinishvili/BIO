The first line of input will consist of a single integer, $n$ $(1 \le n \le 2^{10})$,
indicating the number of films. This will be followed by a line for every possible
pairing of distinct films, each containing two integers, $w$ then $l$
$(1 \le w, l \le n; w \ne l)$ indicating that film $w$ beat $l$.
No pair of films will be repeated.
