The movie studio \it{Greenlight Casting Couch} are looking to promote their past
films and have recently completed extensive market research. Every pair of their
films has been compared, with a clear best determined in each case. The studio
intends to use this information to order their films so that each film is better than
the \it{immediately} preceding film in their list.

During research the $n$ films were referred to by unique integers from $1$ to $n$.
(The studio will be avoiding the mistake they made several years ago, and intends
to use the actual names in their marketing.)

For example, suppose that there are four films and $a>b$ indicates testing
showed $a$ was better than $b$. If $1>2$, $2>3$, $3>1$, $4>1$, $4>2$ and $4>3$, the following
lists are all valid: $3$ $2$ $1$ $4$, $2$ $1$ $3$ $4$ and $1$ $3$ $2$ $4$.
Note that consumers are fickle and $1>2$, $2>3$ and $3>1$ !

For any market research there is always a valid list.
