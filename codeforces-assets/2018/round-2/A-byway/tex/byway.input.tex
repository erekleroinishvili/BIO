The first line of input will consist of a single integer $v$, $(2 \le v \le 2^{12})$,
indicating the number of villages. Each successive line will consist of a pair of
integers, indicating two villages directly connected by a byway, followed by an
even integer $t$, $(2 \le t \le 2^{50})$, indicating the time it takes to traverse that
byway (in either direction). Each byway will be given once. The input will be
terminated by the line $-1 -1 -1$.
