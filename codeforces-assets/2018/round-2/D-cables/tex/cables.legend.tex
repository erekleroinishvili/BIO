The family firm of Widget, Whatsit & Doodah (est. 1862) has recently sold off
one of their warehouses and, being experts in all manner of things, are laying
down cabling for the new buyer. Power-points have been installed in a squared
grid, and the buyer has asked for some of these to be connected in loops.

For reasons unknown, the buyer has specified $s \cdot l$ of the power-points, and
requested that they be connected together into $l$ loops, each containing $s$ distinct
points. No three specified power-points lie in a straight line. Connected points in
a loop are joined by a single, straight physical cable. Health & Safety dictates that
cables in a single loop are only allowed to intersect at power-points, and no
cables in different loops are allowed to intersect.

It is up to Mr Thingummy (no relation) and his craftsmen to decide which
power-points are in each loop. The buyer (or at least the sales contract) will be
satisfied by any solution.

For example, the figure shows a potential way of linking 8 power-points into 2
loops each containing 4 power-points.
