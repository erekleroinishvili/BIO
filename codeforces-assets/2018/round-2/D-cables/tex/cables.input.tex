The first line of input will consist of two positive integers,
$s$ $(3 \le s)$ then $l$ $(1 \le l)$, with $s \cdot l < 2^{13}$,
indicating the size and number of loops respectively. Each of the
next $s \cdot l$ lines will contain two integers, $x_i$ and $y_i$
$(0 \le xi, yi < 2^{16})$, indicating the coordinates of the
$i^{th}$ power-point. No two power-points will be at the same position.
