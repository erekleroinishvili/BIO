An uneasy truce exists between the spies of \it{Alpha Complex} and \it{Beta Complex}
but some fundamental differences exist on core pillars of ideology. These
differences are so deep-seated that arranging the seating in shared complex space
is, quite frankly, complex.

A large warehouse has just been acquired from a local company and powerpoints
have been installed in a square grid. Desks have been placed at some of
these points and the spies need to be allocated desks. To avoid a cold war over
this hot issue, in any row or column the number of spies from \it{Alpha Complex}
must be no more than one different from the number of \it{Beta Complex} spies.

For example, if desks had been placed at $(0,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$ and $(0,20)$, and
$(0,0)$ contained an \it{Alpha Complex} spy:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The spy at $(10,0)$ would have to be from Beta Complex, hence the row $(x,0)$
  contains one of each spy;

  \item At least one of the spies in $(0,10)$ and $(0,20)$ would have to be from
  \it{Beta Complex}, so the row $(0,y)$ would have one spy from one complex and
  two from the other
\end{itemize}

For any set of desks there is always a solution
