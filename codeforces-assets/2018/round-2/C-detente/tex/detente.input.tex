The first line of input will consist of a single integer, $n$ $(1 \le n < 2^{13})$,
indicating the number of desks. Each of the next $n$ lines will contain two integers,
$x_i$ and $y_i$ $(0 \le x_i, y_i < 2^{16})$, indicating the co-ordinates of the $i^{th}$ desk. No two desks will be at the same position.
