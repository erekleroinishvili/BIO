The first line of the input will be an integer, $c$ $(1 \le c \le 20)$ indicating the number of cast members. This will be followed by $2^c$ lines, the $i^{th}$ of which will consist of $c$ characters ($u$, $d$, $n$ or $p$) giving the $i^{th}$ combination of hats and the corresponding direction for each cast member. Each combination of hats will appear once and only once in the input.
