The first line of the input will consist of three integers, $n$ $(1 \le n \le 2^{20})$ then $m$ $(1 \le m \le 2n)$ then $c$ $(1 \le c \le 220)$, indicating the number of seats (on each side), items of cutlery and number of times the first spy changes their mind respectively. The next $2$ lines will each consist of $n$ integers (each between $1$ and $m$), indicating the item of cutlery that the spy in each seat has initially picked up. The final line will contain $c$ integers indicating the first spy's changes of mind.
